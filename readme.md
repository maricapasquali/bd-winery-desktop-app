# Desktop application (Java) for management of a winery

This is the final project for the "Basi di dati" course.

The final report is located in the folder "_Relazione_": [RelazioneBasiDati.pdf](/Relazione/RelazioneBasiDati.pdf).


# Run

Just run the `Gestionale.exe` file in the current directory (only Windows System), 
or you may need to run it via command line `java -jar Gestionale.jar`, for all System.

When the application requires `Azienda.accdb`, provide this file as input.
The database does not require a password.
